# Jonny Wilson's vimrc

This configuration is the current version of vimrc that I am running, the aim of
this configuration is to be minimal, and have most of the features that are
useful enabled by default.

At the minute, this configuration is for Windows 10, running gVim. I aim to make
this configuration suitable for both Windows 10 and Linux.


## Installing

Simply clone or copy the files from this github repository, and place them in
the correct folders that Vim looks for them.

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jonnylwilson/vim.git .
